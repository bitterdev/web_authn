# WebAuthn

WebAuthn is a Concrete CMS add-on that enables passwordless authentication using the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard. It allows users to log in securely with passkeys—such as platform authenticators like Touch ID, Face ID, or Windows Hello, as well as cross-platform devices like security keys (e.g., YubiKey). The add-on integrates directly into Concrete CMS’s user authentication system and introduces a new login method that complies with FIDO2 standards. It supports both the registration of new credentials and authentication via browser-native APIs, providing a seamless, secure, and modern login experience without relying on traditional passwords. WebAuthn enhances security while simplifying the login process for end users.
